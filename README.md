## Overview

I've been avoiding re-learning C since I learned it briefly in college. I need to learn at least a bit. This project is
me doing that.

**NOTE**: This project was developed on macOS. It is for my own personal use.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and run a sample program.

1. Pre-requisite: Clang
   * This comes with the Xcode Command Line Tools. I can never remember the procedure to install this. 
2. Compile the code
   * ```shell
     clang -o build/hello hello.c
     ```
3. Run the program
   * ```shell
     ./build/hello
     ```
